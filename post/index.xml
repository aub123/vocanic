      <description>The reason why I wanna establish the blog is mostly that several days ago, I saw many of my classmates having owned their blog. And due to the feeling of admiration, I built my first blog as the notes for my study and the experiences I had or will have this afternoon . It is also a reason that I wanna improve my English level, so that I would write blogs in English in the most cases.</description>
